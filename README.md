# UrnaSscript 
This Script I made this project to put my knowledge into a real thing (this is the 2 version btw), for the first version I used a direct connector for MySQL in Python, and last week I decided to refactor it with ORM (Object-relational mapping) and today I finished, so I publishing this as a project, also if y'all want I can do an English version of it just ask on discord d4vizinvlr. <br> The names were selected **randomly** 
## Installation
